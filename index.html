        <h1>Summary</h1>
        <p>
            I am Huseyin. I've been working as a teacher since 2016. I am married to a wonderful woman, and we have a beautiful daughter. I feel very lucky to have a great family. Recently, I have been living and teaching in Phnom Penh. I am also learning how to be a web developer while taking care of my daughter at home after work. My dream for the future is to become a web developer.
